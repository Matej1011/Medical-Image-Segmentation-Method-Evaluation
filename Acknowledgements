The dataset used for this evaluation of MedSAM and TotalSegmentator is from "The RSNA Cervical Spine Fracture CT Dataset" found here:
https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/ryai.230034

The code for TotalSegmentator can be found on their Github here:
https://github.com/wasserth/TotalSegmentator/blob/master/README.md

MedSAM's original code can be found on their Github here:
https://github.com/bowang-lab/MedSAM

The code for VerSe can be found on their Github here:

For this test I used MedSAM's code on GoogleColab (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19WNtRMbpsxeqimBlmJwtd1dzpaIvK2FZ?usp=sharing) but edited to allow for automatic segmentation of whole .npz files
The edited code (ran on GoogleColab) can be found in this Github repository named "MedSAM_inference.ipynb" along with the edited code for preprocessing the patient's CT images (CT_preprocessing_1024.ipynb)

Many thanks to Zixuan Hu for supervising this project and providing his expertise throughout the process and to Professor Ervin Sejdic for making this project possible.
